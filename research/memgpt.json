Open source, production ready, and fully model-agnostic.\nOpen source, production ready, and fully model-agnostic. Letta Code is a memory-first coding harness, built on top of the Letta API. Instead of working in independent sessions, you work with a persisted agent that learns over time and is portable across models.",
